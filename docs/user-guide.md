# RiskForge user guide

RiskForge is an open-source command-line tool that turns EU AI Act Article 9 risk
management into a developer workflow. You run a guided assessment across 8 risk
dimensions, score and treat each risk, and export a tamper-evident **Risk
Management File** (RMF) shaped for an Annex IV technical documentation pack.

RiskForge is not legal advice and not a notified-body conformity assessment. Every
export carries a non-removable disclosure to that effect.

## Install

```bash
pip install riskforge
```

RiskForge requires Python 3.11 or 3.12. JSON and Markdown export need nothing
beyond the `pip install`. **PDF export** additionally needs the Pango, cairo, and
GDK-PixBuf system libraries (used by WeasyPrint):

- Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get install libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0`
- macOS: `brew install pango`

RiskForge makes zero outbound network calls in CLI mode. This is enforced in the
test suite with `pytest-socket`.

---

## Core concepts

- **System.** The high-risk AI system you are assessing. You register it with
  `riskforge init` and it gets a UUID (the *system id*) used by every later command.
- **Register.** The living record of risk items for a system.
- **Risk item.** One identified risk in one of the 8 dimensions, scored on a 5x5
  likelihood-by-severity matrix (`risk_score = likelihood x severity`, range 1 to 25).
  Bands: low (1 to 4), medium (5 to 9), high (10 to 16), critical (17 to 25).
- **Mitigation.** A control recorded against a risk item, after which you re-score
  the residual likelihood and severity.
- **Validation gates.** Eight readiness checks (G1 to G8) run before export.
- **Risk Management File (RMF).** The export artefact, in JSON, PDF, or Markdown,
  carrying a SHA-256 self-verifying digest and a link to the audit chain.
- **Audit chain.** Every state change is written to an append-only, SHA-256
  hash-chained log, so tampering is detectable with `riskforge verify`.

The 8 dimensions and their shipped question counts (37 total): health_safety (6),
privacy (5), robustness (5), data_governance (5), discrimination (4),
fundamental_rights (4), human_oversight (4), transparency (4).

## Quickstart: a worked example

An AI CV-screening system for hiring (an Annex III employment use case).

```bash
# 1. Register the system (prints the system id)
riskforge init \
  --name "TalentScreen CV Ranker" \
  --sys-version "3.2.0" \
  --purpose "Automated resume screening and candidate ranking for hiring." \
  --provider "Northwind HR Technologies GmbH" \
  --category employment

# 2. Record your Article 6(2) Annex III self-classification (clears gate G2)
riskforge system classify <system-id> --confirm

# 3. Run the guided 8-dimension assessment
riskforge assess <system-id> \
  --assessor-name "Dr. Lena Fischer" \
  --assessor-role "AI Governance Lead"

# 4. Record a mitigation and accept residual risk (optional but expected for high risks)
riskforge risk list <system-id>
riskforge risk mitigate <system-id> <risk-id> \
  -m "Remove postcode feature; add demographic parity monitoring" \
  -c preventive --owner "ML Platform" --residual-likelihood 2 --residual-severity 3
riskforge risk accept <system-id> <risk-id> --rationale "Residual within appetite after controls."

# 5. Check readiness (exit 1 if a FAIL gate is unmet)
riskforge validate <system-id>

# 6. Export the RMF
riskforge export <system-id> --format pdf --output rmf.pdf
riskforge export <system-id> --format json --output rmf.json

# 7. Verify integrity later (exit 2 if tampered)
riskforge verify --file rmf.json
```

The Annex III category is one of: `biometric`, `critical_infrastructure`,
`education`, `employment`, `essential_services`, `law_enforcement`, `migration`,
`justice`. A category plus matching purpose keywords triggers a pre-built risk
pattern (for example, `employment` + "hiring/resume/screening" triggers the hiring
pattern), whose risk items are added for your confirmation.

---

## Non-interactive assessment

`assess` is interactive by default. For CI, reproducible fixtures, or scripted
sample data, drive it from a YAML answers file:

```bash
riskforge assess <system-id> \
  -a "Dr. Lena Fischer" -r "AI Governance Lead" \
  --answers answers.yaml
```

```yaml
# answers.yaml
add_patterns: true          # inject matched Annex III patterns (default true)
answers:
  PR-001: { applies: yes, likelihood: 4, severity: 5 }   # yes | no | unknown | skip
  HS-001: { applies: unknown }        # knowledge gap (uses the question's hints)
  DISC-001: { applies: no }           # not applicable
  # questions omitted from the file default to "skip"
```

`applies: yes` adds a scored risk item (likelihood and severity required).
`applies: unknown` flags a knowledge gap and derives a test requirement later.
Question ids come from the bundled question bank (see the files under
`src/riskforge/_data/question_bank/`).

## Command reference

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `riskforge init -n NAME -s VERSION -p PURPOSE --provider ORG [-c CATEGORY]` | Create a project and register a system; prints the system id. |
| `riskforge system show <id>` | Print the system record as JSON. |
| `riskforge system classify <id> --confirm [-c CATEGORY]` | Record the Article 6(2) Annex III self-classification (clears gate G2), audited. |
| `riskforge assess <id> -a NAME -r ROLE [--dimension DIM] [--answers FILE]` | Run the assessment, interactive or from an answers file. |
| `riskforge risk list <id> [-d DIMENSION]` | List risk items (id, dimension, score, band, accepted). |
| `riskforge risk mitigate <id> <risk-id> -m DESC -c TYPE --owner OWNER [--status S] [--residual-likelihood N] [--residual-severity N]` | Add a mitigation and optionally re-score residual risk, audited. |
| `riskforge risk accept <id> <risk-id> -r RATIONALE` | Accept a residual risk with a documented rationale, audited. |
| `riskforge tests generate <id>` | Derive Article 9(6) to 9(8) test requirements from open and knowledge-gap risks. |
| `riskforge validate <id> [--force]` | Run the 8 readiness gates. |
| `riskforge export <id> [-f json\|pdf\|markdown] [-o PATH] [--sign KEYID] [--force]` | Export the RMF. |
| `riskforge verify [--file rmf.json] [--project-dir DIR]` | Verify the audit chain, or a standalone RMF's digest with `--file`. |
| `riskforge diff <id> BASELINE.json COMPARISON.json` | Show changes between two exported RMFs. |
| `riskforge import <id> -a ADAPTER -r REPORT.json` | Import an upstream tool report (adapters: `rag-benchmarking`, `traceforge`). |
| `riskforge serve [--host H] [--port P] [--allow-external]` | Start the optional, experimental API server (`pip install riskforge[server]`). |

Risk ids accept the first 8 characters shown by `riskforge risk list`. The
`--sign` value is a GPG key identifier (email, key id, or fingerprint), not a file
path; signing produces a detached `.asc` next to the export.

### The 8 validation gates

| Gate | Check | On failure |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | All 8 dimensions have at least one entry | FAIL |
| G2 | Article 6(2) self-classification documented | FAIL |
| G3 | Above-threshold risks mitigated or accepted | FAIL |
| G4 | Knowledge gaps have test requirements | WARN |
| G5 | System metadata complete | FAIL |
| G6 | Assessor identity recorded | FAIL |
| G7 | Risk-score distribution plausible | WARN |
| G8 | No vague mitigation language | WARN |

FAIL gates block export unless you pass `--force`. WARN gates are advisory.

---

## Exit codes (for CI)

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Success or valid |
| 1 | Recoverable error, or a validation FAIL gate without `--force` |
| 2 | Audit chain corrupt or tampered, or an RMF file that does not match its digest |

`verify` returns 2 on any tamper, which makes it usable as a CI gate.

---

## Continuous integration recipe

Store the `.riskforge/` directory and the exported `rmf.json` in your repository,
then fail the build if either the audit chain or the exported file has been altered:

```yaml
- run: pip install riskforge
- run: riskforge verify                 # audit chain intact (exit 2 on tamper)
- run: riskforge verify --file rmf.json  # exported RMF matches its digest
```

To re-run an assessment on a model change without a human at the terminal, keep an
`answers.yaml` in the repo and run `riskforge assess <id> --answers answers.yaml`
followed by `riskforge validate <id>`.

---

## Interpreting the RMF

The JSON RMF has these top-level fields: `id`, `rmf_schema_version`, `register`,
`test_requirements`, `cross_references`, `generated_at`, `sha256_hash`, `signed_by`,
`audit_entry_hash`, and `disclosure`. The `register` holds the system record, the
risk items, the assessor, dates, and the risk-appetite threshold. Each risk item
carries its dimension, scoring, mitigations, residual scoring, acceptance, and
Article/NIST/ISO references.

`sha256_hash` is computed over the document content with the integrity fields
(`sha256_hash`, `audit_entry_hash`, `signed_by`) blanked, so `riskforge verify
--file` can recompute and confirm it. `audit_entry_hash` links the file to the
`rmf.exported` entry in the audit chain.

The PDF renders the same data as a filing-ready document: cover, executive summary,
risk register, test requirements, audit trail, and the mandatory disclosure.

## Extending RiskForge (plugins)

RiskForge discovers question banks, exporters, and adapters through Python
entry points, so you extend it by `pip install`-ing a package, with no config edit.

- **Question banks:** entry-point group `riskforge.question_banks`. The simplest
  contribution needs zero Python: add a question to a YAML file under
  `src/riskforge/_data/question_bank/` and open a PR. See
  [`docs/contributing/add-question.md`](contributing/add-question.md).
- **Risk patterns:** add a YAML block to `src/riskforge/_data/patterns/patterns.yaml`.
  See [`docs/contributing/add-pattern.md`](contributing/add-pattern.md).
- **Exporters:** entry-point group `riskforge.exporters` (json, pdf, markdown ship
  built in). See [`docs/contributing/add-exporter.md`](contributing/add-exporter.md).
- **Adapters:** entry-point group `riskforge.adapters` (rag-benchmarking and
  traceforge ship built in).

## Limitations and disclosure

- RiskForge is not a legal compliance determination and not legal advice.
- It is not a notified-body conformity assessment. The RMF is one input to that
  separate process.
- It does not decide whether a system is high-risk under Annex III. It records the
  provider's Article 6(2) self-classification (gate G2); it does not make it.
- The optional API server is experimental, not security-hardened, and not part of
  the flagship test suite. Run it only on a trusted, local network.

Every export carries this non-removable disclosure: the document was produced using
RiskForge, represents the team's documented risk assessment, has not been reviewed
by a qualified legal professional, and does not constitute legal advice.

## FAQ

**Does my risk data leave my machine?** No. RiskForge makes zero outbound calls in
CLI mode. The only exception is if you explicitly run the optional API server.

**Can I edit the state files by hand?** They are plain YAML and JSONL, readable and
diff-able. Editing the `.riskforge/audit.jsonl` chain will be detected by
`riskforge verify` (exit 2). Editing a register outside the tool is possible but
not recommended.

**Why does validation fail with G2 even after `init`?** `init` records the Annex III
category but not the self-classification confirmation. Run
`riskforge system classify <id> --confirm` to clear G2.

**Where do exports go by default?** To the project directory, named
`rmf-<id-prefix>-<export-id>.<ext>`, unless you pass `--output`.

**How do I re-assess on a model change?** Keep an `answers.yaml` and run
`riskforge assess <id> --answers answers.yaml`, then `validate` and `export`.
